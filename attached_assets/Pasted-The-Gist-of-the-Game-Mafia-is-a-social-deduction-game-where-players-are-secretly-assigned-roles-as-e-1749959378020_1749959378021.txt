The Gist of the Game
Mafia is a social deduction game where players are secretly assigned roles as either members of the Mafia or innocent Townspeople. The goal of the Mafia is to eliminate Townspeople until they equal the number of innocents. The Townspeople's objective is to discover and eliminate all members of the Mafia before they are outnumbered. The game is played in alternating "night" and "day" phases, led by a non-playing narrator.

The Roles
The beauty of Mafia lies in its diverse roles, which can vary from game to game. Here are the most common ones:

Mafia: The informed minority. They know who their fellow Mafia members are and work together in secret to "kill" off a Townsperson each night. During the day, they must blend in and pretend to be innocent.
Townspeople (or Villagers): The uninformed majority. They do not know who is a friend and who is a foe. Their goal is to deduce the identity of the Mafia members and vote to eliminate them during the day.

Doctor (a special Townsperson): Each night, the Doctor can choose one person to save. If the Mafia targets the same person, that person survives. The Doctor can usually save themselves, but this ability may be limited to once per game.
Detective (a special Townsperson): Each night, the Detective can investigate one player to learn if they are a member of the Mafia. The narrator will silently signal to the Detective whether their suspicion is correct or not. The Detective must be careful with this information to avoid becoming a target for the Mafia.
More complex versions of the game can include additional roles with unique abilities, adding more layers of strategy and intrigue.

The Gameplay: A Cycle of Night and Day
The game is guided by a narrator who is not a player and knows everyone's role. Here's how the phases typically unfold:

The Night Phase
"Everyone, close your eyes." The narrator begins the night phase by instructing all players to close their eyes.
"Mafia, open your eyes." The Mafia members silently identify each other.
"Mafia, choose someone to eliminate." The Mafia members silently and unanimously agree on one player to "kill." They then indicate their choice to the narrator.
"Mafia, close your eyes."
"Doctor, open your eyes. Who would you like to save?" The Doctor points to one player to protect. The narrator acknowledges the choice.
"Doctor, close your eyes."
"Detective, open your eyes. Who would you like to investigate?" The Detective points to one player. The narrator will give a silent thumbs-up (if they are Mafia) or thumbs-down (if they are a Townsperson).
"Detective, close your eyes."
The Day Phase
"Everyone, open your eyes." The narrator announces the events of the night, often with a dramatic flair. They will reveal who was targeted by the Mafia and whether the Doctor's save was successful. If a player was killed, their role is usually revealed, and they are out of the game.
Discussion and Accusation. The living players discuss who they suspect is in the Mafia. This is the core of the game, where players can bluff, form alliances, and try to read each other. The Mafia will try to sow discord and cast suspicion on innocent players. Special roles, like the Detective, may try to subtly guide the discussion without revealing their identity.

The Vote. After a period of discussion, players vote to eliminate one suspect. A player may be put on "trial" and given a chance to defend themselves before a final vote.
The Verdict. The player with the most votes is "lynched" and eliminated from the game. Their role is revealed, and they can no longer participate in the discussion or voting.
Winning the Game
The game continues with alternating night and day phases until one of two conditions is met:

The Townspeople win when they have successfully eliminated all members of the Mafia.
The Mafia wins when the number of Mafia members is equal to the number of Townspeople, giving them the majority vote and control of the town.
Mafia is a game of strategy, deception, and social deduction that can be a highly engaging and entertaining activity for a group of friends.
